Description: SBBS - Synchronet BBS Software
 Synchronet Bulletin Board System (SBBS) Software is a free software package
 that can turn your personal computer into your own custom online service
 supporting multiple simultaneous users with hierarchical message and file
 areas, multi-user chat, and the ever-popular BBS door games. Command shells
 available include:  Synchronet (Classic), Synchronet (Novice), WWIV Clone,
 PCBoard Clone, Wildcat Clone, MajorBBS Clone, & a Renegade Clone. Baja and
 Server Side Javascript are available with the package for scripting.
 Synchronet development began in 1990 as a program for single-tasking MS-DOS
 compatible computers and Hayes compatible modems.  In November of 1999, the
 author began further development of Synchronet specifically for the Internet
 community and it has since been substantially redesigned as an Internet
 capable BBS package for Win32 and Unix-x86 platforms integrating standard
 Internet protocols such as Telnet, SSH, FTP, SMTP, POP3, IRC, NNTP, and HTTP.
